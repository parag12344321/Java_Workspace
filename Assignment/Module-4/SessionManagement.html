* Overview of session management techniques: cookies, hidden form fields, URL rewriting,
and sessions.
- Session management is crucial in web development, as it enables a server to maintain 
  user-specific data across multiple interactions.
1. Cookies:
- Small text files stored in the user's browser by the server, containing session data or 
  identifiers.
- When a user visits a website, the server can set cookies in their browser. 
  These cookies store information, like session IDs, that the server reads on subsequent requests
  to identify the user.
2. Hidden Form Fields:
- Hidden fields are form inputs not visible to the user, containing session-related information.
- The server embeds session data into hidden form fields. Each time the user submits a form, 
  this session data is sent back to the server. The server can then use this information to 
  maintain continuity across requests.
- Useful in multi-step forms where session continuity is needed only within specific pages.
- Security concerns as data is visible in the HTML source and can be manipulated.
3. URL Rewriting:
- Embedding session information directly in the URL, typically by appending a session ID as a query parameter.
- When a user navigates, the server appends session data to the URL (e.g., example.com/page?sessionid=12345).
- The server reads this data on each request to identify the session.
- Works well for users who have cookies disabled.
- Session data is exposed in URLs, which can be a security risk.
4. Sessions (Server-Side Session Management):
- Session data stored on the server, with the client receiving a unique session identifier
 (often a cookie) that links them to this data.
- When a user begins a session, the server generates a unique session ID and stores session-related
  data in server memory or a database.
- The session ID is then shared with the client, often through a cookie. 
  Each subsequent request includes this session ID, enabling the server to retrieve session data.
- Advantages : Secure, as session data stays on the server.
- Disadvantages: Scalability challenges if using in-memory storage (can be mitigated with database storage).


* How to track user sessions in web applications.
- Tracking user sessions is essential in web applications for purposes like maintaining 
  login states, gathering analytics, or personalizing the user experience.
- The popular techniques for tracking user sessions:
1. Cookies:
- Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client’s browser.
- When a user visits your site, a session ID or token is generated by the server and sent to the client as a cookie.
- This ID is sent back with each subsequent request, allowing the server to recognize the user’s session.
- Supported across all browsers, easy to implement.
2. Sessions (Server-Side Storage):
- Sessions store data about users on the server side and typically use cookies to identify users.
- When a user logs in, a session ID is created and stored on the server. 
- The client receives a session token (often in a cookie) that is used to identify their session in subsequent requests.
- More secure because sensitive data isn’t stored on the client; sessions can easily be expired or invalidated.
- More secure because sensitive data isn’t stored on the client; sessions can easily be expired or invalidated.
3. Local Storage or Session Storage (Client-Side):
- HTML5 Local Storage and Session Storage provide ways to store data on the client side.
- JavaScript can be used to set data in localStorage (persistent) or sessionStorage (clears when the tab is closed).
- Data is easily accessible and modifiable by JavaScript.
4. JWTs (JSON Web Tokens):
- JWTs are secure tokens that store encoded user data.
- When a user logs in, a JWT is generated, containing the user’s session data in an encoded format.
 This token is sent to the client (often stored in local storage or a cookie) and returned with each request.
- Works well in distributed and stateless architectures; supports easy authentication for microservices.
5. Database-Driven Sessions:
- Session data is stored in a database, often with an identifier shared with the client.
- Each session is associated with a unique identifier stored in the database, and this ID is sent to the client in a cookie. 
- Database read/write operations can introduce latency.
6. Tracking by IP Address:
- Track user sessions by monitoring IP addresses.
- This method checks the user’s IP address to maintain session continuity.
- IP addresses change (mobile networks, VPNs, etc.) and aren’t unique identifiers.
7. Fingerprinting:
- Tracks users based on various client characteristics, such as browser type, screen resolution, or installed plugins.
- Collect a “fingerprint” based on these characteristics and use it to identify returning users.
- Privacy concerns, limited reliability due to changes in user configuration.
