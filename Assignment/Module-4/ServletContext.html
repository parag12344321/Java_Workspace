* Introduction to ServletContext and its scope.
- ServletContext is a powerful interface in Java web development used in servlets 
  for accessing various aspects of a web application's environment and managing shared data across servlets.
- ServletContext represents the environment of a web application running on a servlet container, such as Tomcat.
- Each web application deployed on a servlet container has a unique ServletContext object created
  when the application is initialized.
  
-> Scope of ServletContext:
- The scope of ServletContext is application-wide; it is shared among all servlets, JSPs, 
  filters, and other components within a single web application.
- ServletContext exists from the time the application is started.
- when the servlet container initializes it the server is shut down.
- Because of its application-wide scope, itâ€™s suitable for storing data that needs to be shared
  across multiple servlets and is not tied to a single user session.
  
* How to use web application listeners for lifecycle events.
- Web application listeners are useful for tracking and managing lifecycle events in a 
  web application, such as application startup, shutdown, session creation, and destruction.
-> listeners for lifecycle events:
1. Types of Listeners:
a) ServletContextListener: Triggered when the application context (overall application) is 
   initialized or destroyed.
b) ServletRequestListener: Monitors request lifecycle events, such as request initialization and destruction.
c) HttpSessionListener: Tracks session lifecycle events, like session creation and invalidation.
2. ServletContextListener:
- A ServletContextListener can handle application-wide initialization and cleanup tasks.
3. HttpSessionListener:
- An HttpSessionListener tracks the lifecycle of HTTP sessions.
4. Setting Up a ServletRequestListener: 
- A ServletRequestListener allows you to listen to the start and end of each requestâ€™s lifecycle.
5. Registering Listeners in web.xml:
- Alternatively, you can register listeners in the web.xml file if your environment doesn't support annotations.
6. Using Listeners in Spring Boot:
- Spring Boot applications often use ApplicationListener to listen for context refresh, close, or specific Spring events.
